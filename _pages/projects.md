# Carbon Dashboard 
## \[May 2020 - July 2020\]
Worked on the project Carbon Dashboard which provides granular insights and analysis of carbon emissions across buildings.
Developed a Time Series Model using Machine Learning to predict the attendance of people, to allow better planning, reducing the wastage
of resources and carbon emission.
Used features like trend, seasonality and correlation for tuning the model and interfaced the result and metrics on PowerBI dashboard. Tech
stack used: PySpark, Python, SQL, Databricks, PowerBI and Azure services.
Worked on the project during my internship at Microsoft. The project achieved 2nd place globally in the domain Hack for Sustainability at the Microsoft Global Hackathon 2020.

# Machine Learning Algorithms for Structural Health Monitoring 
## \[May 2020 - June 2020\]
SUPERVISOR: DR. KOTA SOLOMON RAJU & DR. GAURAV PUROHIT, CSIR‑CEERI, PILANI
Worked on the project during my internship at CEERI Pilani. 
Built deep learning models for Monitoring the Health of Building Structures which allows keeping track of structural damage using features
like interstory drift ratio and data from accelerometer signals. Used CNNs on simulated accelerometer data for classifying structural state based on damage. This can help address vulnerable structures and prevent the loss of life and property after a natural disaster. [GITHUB LINK](https://github.com/vishwa27yvs/Structural-Health-Monitoring)

# Modelling The Cognitive Functions of Consumer Behaviour 
## \[Jan 2020 - May 2020\]
SUPERVISOR: PROF. BHARAT DESHPANDE, BITS PILANI, K K BIRLA GOA CAMPUS | GITHUB LINK
This project aims to predict consumer behaviour using brain wave measurement technology and and machine learning.
Processed the collected brain data‑EEG signals using MATLAB EEGlab toolkit.
Developed a Machine Learning Model in Python to predict consumer behaviour using classification algorithms like K‑ Nearest Neighbors and
Random Forest on the processed EEG data. [GITHUB LINK](https://github.com/vishwa27yvs/ML-and-Consumer-Neuroscience)

# Markov Chain Model For Natural Language 
## \[Jan 2019\]
Used a Markov Chain to create probability distribution of each successive letter depending on the preceding letters for a piece of English text.
Simulated Markov chain to generate pseudo‑random text in Java from this probabilistic distribution. [GITHUB LINK](https://github.com/vishwa27yvs/Intro-to-Computer-Science-COS-126/tree/master/Markov%20Model)
