I was a Teaching Assistant for the course Computer Programming at BITS Pilani K K Birla Goa Campus (Jan 2020- May 2020). The course covers fundamentals of Computer Programming along with a lab component for programming in C for first-year students. As a teaching assistant, I solved general doubts during weekly C programming labs, set up coding questions, evaluated and conducted labs.
